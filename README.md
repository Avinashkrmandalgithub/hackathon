# 🫀 Organ Donation & Transplant Matching System

A *full-stack MERN platform* that connects *organ donors* with *recipients* through an intelligent *matching algorithm*.  
Built for *NEXATHON 1.0, this project aims to **save lives* by making organ allocation *faster, smarter, and more transparent*.  

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement  

Every year, thousands of patients lose their lives due to the *delay in finding suitable organ donors*.  
Current systems are:  

- ❌ Manual & region-limited  
- ❌ Prone to delays & inefficiencies  
- ❌ Lacking real-time transparency  

We need a *scalable, digital-first solution* that ensures *fair, fast, and efficient donor-recipient matching*.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  

A *centralized web platform* designed for *real-time donor-recipient matching* with:  

- 📝 *Donor & Recipient Registration* with secure authentication (JWT & bcrypt).  
- 🔍 *Matching Algorithm* (blood type, medical urgency, organ type, geographic proximity).  
- ⚡ *Real-time Compatibility Scoring* using MongoDB queries & Node.js logic.  
- 📢 *Instant Notifications* via Email/SMS/WhatsApp APIs.  
- 🔒 *Secure & Transparent Data Handling* (role-based access for hospitals, patients, authorities).  
- 🌐 *Scalable Cloud Deployment* with CI/CD pipelines.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (MERN + Tailwind)  

- *Frontend:* React.js + TailwindCSS + Axios + JWT Auth  
- *Backend:* Node.js + Express.js (REST APIs)  
- *Database:* MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)  
- *Authentication & Security:* JWT, bcrypt, role-based access control  
- *Notifications:* Twilio / Nodemailer / Firebase Cloud Messaging  
- *Deployment:* Docker + AWS / Vercel / Render  

*Optional Advanced Features:*  
- Blockchain ledger for transparent allocation tracking  
- WebSockets for real-time updates

## 🔗 System Workflow  

1. *User Registration* → Donor/Recipient enters details → securely stored in MongoDB.  
2. *Matching Engine* → Node.js algorithm calculates compatibility score.  
3. *Dashboard View* → Hospitals see top matches ranked by urgency & compatibility.  
4. *Notifications* → Automatic alerts sent to recipients & hospitals when a match is found.  
5. *Approval & Transplant* → Legal/ethical checks before surgery.

## 🌟 Key Features  

✅ Centralized digital organ registry  
✅ Compatibility scoring system (blood type, organ type, urgency, location)  
✅ Real-time donor-recipient suggestions  
✅ Secure hospital/admin panel  
✅ Cloud-hosted & scalable solution
